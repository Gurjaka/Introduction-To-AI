## 📦 Data Usage

Since projects vary across modules, data sources and formats will be determined based on the topic and scope of each assignment. Students are encouraged to explore a range of resources including:

* Publicly available datasets
* National statistics
* Crowdsourced or manually collected data
* Web scraping and APIs (where appropriate)

> 🛠️ Flexibility is key — creativity and initiative in sourcing data are encouraged throughout the course.

---

## 🏁 Final Project

The program culminates in a capstone AI project, where students apply acquired knowledge to a real-world problem using data-driven AI techniques. Deliverables include:

* Problem analysis
* Model selection and justification
* Data sourcing and processing
* Visualizations and evaluation metrics
* Live or slide-based presentation
