## ‚öôÔ∏è Development Environment (planned via Nix)

Key dependencies:

* Python 3.11+
* JupyterLab / Google Colab
* Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Manim (visual explanation tools)

`flake.nix` support is planned for reproducible development environments.

## üì¶ Data Usage

Since projects vary across modules, data sources and formats will be determined based on the topic and scope of each assignment. Students are encouraged to explore a range of resources including:

* Publicly available datasets
* National statistics
* Crowdsourced or manually collected data
* Web scraping and APIs (where appropriate)

> üõ†Ô∏è Flexibility is key ‚Äî creativity and initiative in sourcing data are encouraged throughout the course.

---

## üèÅ Final Project

The program culminates in a capstone AI project, where students apply acquired knowledge to a real-world problem using data-driven AI techniques. Deliverables include:

* Problem analysis
* Model selection and justification
* Data sourcing and processing
* Visualizations and evaluation metrics
* Live or slide-based presentation

## üñ•Ô∏è Tmux

The tmux.sh script sets up a custom tmux session for an organized development environment. It creates a tmux session named "Introduction-To-AI", splits the terminal window into multiple panes for different tasks, and launches relevant programs in each pane. This setup allows the user to code, track tasks, compile and run a programs simultaneously in a single terminal session.

Layout:
```bash
